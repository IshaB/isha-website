Hi there!

My name is Isha and I am a Sociology PhD Candidate at UC Irvine. I study how AI-mediated platforms shape work, social life, and wellbeing, with particular attention to gender, accessibility, inequality, development, and culture in Majority World contexts. I am proficient in a range of qualitative and quantitive methods, with particular interest in community-based and participatory approaches. I have worked on a range of projects around these topics and others, with a variety of collaborators and teams across South Asia, UK, US and Sub-Saharan Africa. You can check out some of my projects [here](/#projects). 

My dissertation project examines the implications of AI-mediated platform work in India through the lived experiences of women workers, with a focus on organizational cultures, intersectional inequalities, and strategies of resistance against algorithmic control. It is a mixed-methods study with over 175 gig workers, platform managers and union organizers in Mumbai. I am deeply invested in applying historical-comparative and interdisciplinary perspectives to platform research, in order to assess and mitigate the potential harms of AI technologies.

I am on the job market, interested in post-doc roles and suitable industry positions starting Summer 2024. Please get in touch if you have openings!
