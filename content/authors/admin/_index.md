Hi there!

My name is Isha and I am a Sociology PhD Candidate at UC Irvine. I study how internet platforms shape work and social life, with particular attention to gender, technology, work, wellbeing, and culture in Majority Worlds. I am proficient in range of qualitative and quantitive methods, with particular interest in community-based and participatory approaches. I have worked on a range of projects around these topics and others, with a variety of collaborators and teams across South Asia, UK, US and Africa. You can check out my projects [here](/#projects). 

My dissertation project examines the gender dynamics of platform work in India, with a focus on organizational cultures, intersectional inequalities, and strategies of resistance against algorithmic control. It is a mixed-methods study with over 175 gig workers, platform managers and union organizers in Mumbai. I am deeply invested in applying historical-comparative and interdisciplinary perspectives to platform research, including showing how platform work today marks a return to some of the core features of previous work paradigms.

I am on the job market, looking for post-doc roles starting Summer 2024. Please get in touch if you have openings!
