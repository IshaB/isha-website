I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at UC Irvine. I study how internet platforms shape social life, with particular attention to gender, technology, work, accessibility, wellbeing, and culture in the Global South. I am proficient in range of qualitative and quantitive methods, with particular interest in community-based, participatory and mixed-methods approaches. I have worked on a range of projects around these topics and others, with a variety of collaborators and teams across South Asia, UK, US and Africa. You can check out my projects [here](/#projects). 

My dissertation project (ongoing) examines the gender dynamics of platform work in India through interviews, group discussions, demographic surveys, in-depth ethnography and participant observation with a range of platform workers in Mumbai. I am deeply invested in approaching research through inter-disciplinary perspectives, and am looking for suitable industry work and post-doc roles post-PhD (starting Spring 2024).
