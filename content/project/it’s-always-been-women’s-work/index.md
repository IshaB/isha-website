At a global moment where anxieties about work, security, inequality, and the future are drastically rising, intensified by the pandemic, my dissertation project uses the case of women gig workers in India to address questions about the ‘future of work’ by investigating the ‘history of work’. Through a focus on gig work and women’s work, this project engages with and revisits fundamental questions such as ‘what counts as work?’, ‘how should we value workers?’, and ‘how does work shape social order?’. I pose my research questions within three thematic areas: technology and labor rights; urbanization and social mobility; and gender and the body. 

I apply an intersectional approach that focuses on the lived experiences of so called “low-skilled” women gig workers such as beauty workers and drivers, whose labor is essential to keep platform infrastructure alive and running, and who work not from high-rise offices but on the streets, inside homes, and in limbo spaces like cars, moving in and out of city spaces during their workday. The labor contributions of this group are invisibilized due to the intersectional inequalities produced by gender, caste and class, here operating in a transnational context. At an organizational level, I aim to examine how the industry of platform work is systematically gendered and how this shapes companies’ treatment of workers. At an individual and interactional level, I am interested in investigating women’s lived experiences of work and how the platformization of daily life shapes and reshapes social relations of gender, caste and class in the city. This project is situated in Mumbai, and will be carried out in 2022 using a combination of archival research, ethnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. Through it, I will deconstruct and explore the relationship between gender, technology and urbanization in contemporary India.
