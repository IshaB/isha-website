As a research intern at the Dept. of Social Policy and Intervention at Oxford, I helped design a research project that employs a novel qualitative methodology called Merging of Knowledge, to study the multiple dimensions of poverty across 6 countries (Bangladesh, Bolivia, Tanzania, France, Great Britain and the USA). Using literature reviews, stakeholder meetings & discussions, and research design workshops, I helped adapt this methodology, which was previously used only in small-scale settings, to this large-scale project. 

The project was then undertaken by national teams that included people in poverty, practitioners and academics as equal contributors to the research process. The findings have been presented at the UN and OECD. I am currently working with Dr. Bray as well as researchers from the Tanzanian national team to develop a paper on the use of this methodology in Tanzania. Dr. Bray and I have previously written 3 methodological working papers on Merging of Knowledge, presented at a research design workshop at Oxford.
