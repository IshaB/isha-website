abstract: In broader debates about global energy, the issue of cooking energy
  has recently started receiving fresh attention. In India, though this is an
  issue with major payoffs for health, livelihoods, climate change and domestic
  production, it often tends to be pitched exclusively as a ‘women’s issue’ even
  as women’s needs do not seem to be adequately addressed in energy policies and
  programs. In India, though the rationale for cooking fuel policies has moved
  from saving forests to empowering women, the policy thrust itself seems to be
  moving backwards from a focus on renewables (with the national biogas programs
  in the 1980s) to one on nonrenewables (with national Liquid Petroleum Gas
  programs today). This paper argues that in the long run, energy poverty cannot
  be solved only on the back of nonrenewable energy sources and exclusive
  cooking fuel policies while ignoring the huge potential of renewable energy
  sources which will enable better climate change adaptation and has the
  potential for building new livelihoods. It makes a case for sustainable and
  gender-sensitive interventions and makes feasible suggestions drawing from the
  learning of past policies and programs.
