abstract: In this work, we investigate the presence of occupational gender
  stereotypes in sentiment analysis models. Such a task has implications for
  reducing implicit biases in these models, which are being applied to an
  increasingly wide variety of downstream tasks. We release a new
  gender-balanced dataset of 800 sentences pertaining to specific professions
  and propose a methodology for using it as a test bench to evaluate sentiment
  analysis models. We evaluate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes
  in 3 different models using our approach, and explore their relationship with
  societal perceptions of occupations.
